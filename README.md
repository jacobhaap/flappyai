# Flappy Bird AI

A Flappy Bird AI built from scratch (only core JS libraries), using just normal js arrays. It mutates the best AI flappy bird into 500 and keeps repeating! You can play with the birds by clicking any key (you are red). Click God AI to play against a fully trained bird!

Building this project I learned about neuroevolution and how AI really works!

The actual base flappy bird p5 game was taken from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman)

Unclicensed, so do whatever you want with it!
